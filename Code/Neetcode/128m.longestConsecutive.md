## Approach and Algorithm
1. Two Pointers O(n)::O(n)
Maintain the numbers in a hashmap with value true
For each visited set the mapvalue to false
Use left and right pointer to check if the left < n and right > n exists
If so increase the count and mark the left, right val in map as false
if the current count > longest count store the longest

2.Set Approach (neetcode) O(n)::O(n)
Maintain a set with nums
check if num - 1 exists in set, if not start counting as this is the beginning of a sequence
maintain length = 0 and keep incrementing while we get the num + length in the set
if length > longest set longest to length

### Code
1. Two Pointers O(n)::O(n)
```
    def longestConsecutiveWithPointers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numMap = {}
        longest = 0
        
        for n in nums:
            numMap[n] = True
            
        for n in nums:
            if numMap[n] == False:
               continue 
            numMap[n] = False
            
            current = 1
            left = n - 1
            right = n + 1
            
            while left in numMap:
                numMap[left] = False
                left -= 1
                current += 1
                
            while right in numMap:
                numMap[right] = False
                right += 1
                current += 1
                
            if current >= longest:
                longest = current

        return longest
```

2.Set Approach (neetcode) O(n)::O(n)
```
class Soluton:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 in numSet:
               continue 
            length = 0
            while num + length in numSet:
                length += 1               
            longest = max(length, longest)
        return longesti
```
