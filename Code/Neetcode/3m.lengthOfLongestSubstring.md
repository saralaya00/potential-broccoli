# 3m.lengthOfLongestSubstring.md
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

## Approach and Algorithm
1. Sliding Window with two pointers and a loop O(n)::O(1)
Loop through the String for each character
add character to a set if its not in set
maintain a leftPtr= i and rightPtr=i+1
keep adding to set while string[right] is not in sub
else keep removing left elements and incrementing l till we get to r

return sub.length

2. O(n)::O(1)


### Code
1. O(n)::O(1)
```
class Soluton:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0
        
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```

2. O(n)::O(1)
```

```
