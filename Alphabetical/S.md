### Server
A server is a computer that runs on a network and listens for communications from other computers. When it receives some data from another computer it performs some sort of action in response and - usually - sends back some data of its own. For example, a web server listens on a network for HTTP requests and sends back webpages and information in response. A database server listens for database queries and reads and writes data to the database that it is running.

### Signals
